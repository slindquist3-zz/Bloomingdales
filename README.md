# Bloomingdale's Product Selection Demo
A code challenge for Bloomingdales

## About
This is a product details page. The user has selected a dress to buy, which launches a page with the following details:

1. Product Image
2. Size
3. Color
4. Quantity
5. Price (2 Levels - Orig. and Sale prices with labels and different price values)

When the selection of attributes is done, customer enters shipping address, after which the user clicks a finish button to show the summary of the selected data.

## Tech
  * Backbone.js
  * jQuery
  * Bootstrap
  * SCSS
  * Jasmine Karma

## UI Design Choices
* For a selection method, I decided to stick with radio buttons for two reasons:
1. A user can see all selection options as soon as the page loads.
2. Because a user can see all selection options, there is a shorter user experience between deciding what they want and making a purchase.
